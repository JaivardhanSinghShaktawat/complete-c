# Comments

## What are comments ?

- Comments are used to make code more readable.
- Comments are for developers and not for the compiler.
- Comments are ignored by the compiler and interpreter and are removed during pre-processing step.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // it is a single line comment.

    /*
    It is a multiline comment.
    */

    return 0 ;
}
```
