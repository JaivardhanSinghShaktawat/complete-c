# Introduction

- C language was earlier also important and today also it is important.
- The importance of C language is increasing in today's world also.

## How to choose a programming language to learn ?

- Make sure that the language will remain stable for 5 years.
- The language must be in top 5 in usage statistic.

## Why to learn C language ?

- C language is one of the most popular programming language.
- C language always comes in top 10 each year.
- C language is more than 50 years old but it is still used.
- The scope of C will increase even more.
- C is very demanded in software development.
- C is very fast and easy to use if you know concepts and how to write clean code.
- Programmers have good control over the program in C language because programmers can manage memory manually , interact with operating system and many things.
- If we create efficient algorithm and write very good code in C than that code can reach to the machine code level.
- If we want low latency than we use C language because it is very fast.
- C is the lowest level portable language : C ki madad se hm CPU instructions k bohot jyada pass pohoch skte h.This is what the meaning of lowest level portable language.
- Assembly level language is more low level language and more closer to hardware and operating system but it is difficult to code in assembly level language.

## Applications

- Operating System
- Game Engine
- Linux : Ubuntu , Redhat are distributions of linux.Linux was created by Linus Trovalds.
- MySQL is almost written in C language.
- cython in python is written in C language.
- Ruby , Perl are also written in C.
- First compiler of Java was written in C language.
- Most of the parts of modern operating system that we use today like MacOS , Windows , Linux distributions is written in C language only.
- Libraries of python like numpy , skypy etc are also written in C language only.
- Competitive Programming
- Game Development
- Compilers , databases
- Web Servers
- Network Protocols
- C is used for performance , low latency and where we want more control over hardware and operating system.
- Apache and NGINX are web servers that are also written in C language only.

## Why we do programming and why we need programming langauges ?

Programming languages is a way to interact with the computer.It is a way to interact with the computer.It is an intermediate language between computer and humans.
Computer is a dumb machine and it can't do anything itself.We need to give instructions to it.Computer (CPU) only understands machine level language.Computer don't understand C , C++ and any other language.Computer only understand machine level language.

We write code in a high level language and that code is converted to machine code by using a program which is compiler or interpreter.

Computer understands only machine level language and they don't understand any other language.They don't understand english , C, C++ , Java etc.

## History of C

- C language was created by Denis Ritchie in AT&T Bell Labs (USA).
- AT&T stands for American Telephone and Telegraph.
- Prior to C there were already many programming language like ALGOL , B , BCPL , Fortran , COBOL etc.
- C language became very popular among programmers without any promotion and investment because it was simple , fast and reliable.
- Earlier programming was very tough because there was no IDE and good editors and it was difficult to learn programming earlier.

## Features of C

- Memory management
- Protability
- Functional programming
- Mid Level
- Structured
- Recursion
- Pointers
- Fast
- C was machine independent , it means C program can be compiled according to any machine.
