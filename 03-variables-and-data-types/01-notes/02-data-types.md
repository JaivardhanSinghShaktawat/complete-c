# Data Types

## Types of Data Types

1. Basic data types : These are the basic data types.

Ex : int , char , float , double

2. Derived Data Types : These data types are derived from the basic data types.

Ex : array , pointer , structure , union

3. Enumeration Data Type : enum

4. Void Data Type : it means empty or nothing.

Ex : void

## Data Types Sizes (32 Bit Architecture)

```
Data Types              Memory Size         Range

char                      1 byte            -128 to 127
signed char               1 byte             -128 to 127
unsigned char             1 byte             0 to 255
short                     2 byte             -32,768 to 32,767
signed short              2 byte             -32,768 to 32,767
unsigned short            2 byte             0 to 65,535
int                       2 byte             -32,768 to 32,767
signed int                2 byte             -32,768 to 32,767
unsigned int              2 byte             0 to 65,535
short int                 2 byte             -32,768 to 32,767
signed short int          2 byte             -32,768 to 32,767
unsigned short int        2 byte             0 to 65,535
long int                  4 byte             -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
signed long int           4 byte             -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
unsigned long int         4 byte             0 to 4,294,967,295
float                     4 byte
double                    8 byte
long double               10 byte
```

**Note :** The size of the data type depends upon the architecture like 32 bit or 64 bit.

## How big the RAM is ?

```
4 GB RAM = 4 * 1024 MB

4*1024*1024 KB

4*1024*1024*1024 bytes

4*1024*1024*1024*8 bits
```
